## 📝 Next Steps for You

### Add Your Resume PDF:

1. Create or export your resume as a PDF file
2. Name it exactly: `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in: `d:\PORTFOLIO\personalportfolio\public\`
4. Delete the placeholder file: `RESUME_PLACEHOLDER.txt`

### Test the Resume Page:

1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/resume`
3. Verify PDF displays correctly
4. Test download button
5. Test back button

### Theme Testing:

1. Clear localStorage in browser DevTools (to test first-time experience)
2. Change your system theme (Windows Settings > Personalization > Colors)
3. Refresh the page - theme should match your system
4. Click the sun/moon button to manually override
5. Refresh - your manual choice should persist

## 🎨 How It Works

### Resume Display:

- Uses native browser PDF viewer via iframe
- Height: 80vh (80% of viewport height)
- Scrollable within the container
- Works on all modern browsers

### Theme System:

- Priority: Manual user selection > System preference > Default (light)
- System theme is checked on every page load
- If user hasn't manually set theme, it follows system changes
- Once user clicks toggle, that preference is saved and system changes are ignored

- Firefox: Full support ✅
